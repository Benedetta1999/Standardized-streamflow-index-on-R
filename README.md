This script calculates the standardized streamflow index, on a montlhy scale, given streamflow data from an hydrological station. 

The fitting of the distributions is done through the [fitdist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html) package and is based on the method shown in [Vicente-Serrano et al., 2012](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HE.1943-5584.0000433).

The data in the project is obtained from the [Arpa Piemonte Database](https://www.arpa.piemonte.it/rischi_naturali/snippets_arpa_graphs/map_meteoweb/?rete=stazione_meteorologica).
